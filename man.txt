RACE-GIS
A python program for mapping and visualizing coastal engineering project data.

Design Principals--
Easy to use - GUI, auto launch (to avoid importing woes), self contained executable (no python/installer)
Easy to maintain - Self updating database, informative error messages (examples)
Simple, focused - Reining my over-ambitionn in (animations, DEEP .shp-> KML polygons) to actually doing database
Built to last - Built as a glue to connect AJERA -> Google/Microsoft. Fields future-proofed
Easy to edit - Constants, commented code, Manual. All make it easy to change if something needs to be done.

THOUGHTS INDEV:
Client types from txt file(speed it up?) / Project types
could use a nested list to sort through files (much faster?)
Database as a text file? (speed it up, only write to excel when needed?)
clean up functions/make diagram!
