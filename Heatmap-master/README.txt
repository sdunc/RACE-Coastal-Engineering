# Heatmapper
Takes a list of (lat,longs) and generates a KML heatmap layer

A better implementation would be to generate an image and overlay that onto google earth.



Originally part of the RACE-GIS project. But it's way too time intensive for a real time application.
It will have to be a computational component kept seperate.
Maybe use for the 20 years of RACE idea.
